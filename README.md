# ReactJS Chat App
Welcome to my ReactJS Chat App project, where I showcase my knowledge and skills with the ReactJS framework.
This project focuses on building a real-time chat application, and although **it's still in development**, you can explore
the live version [HERE](https://marcos-chat-ca0e1.web.app/).

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in various ReactJS concepts,
showcasing the application of essential principles for building dynamic and scalable web applications.
While the user interface serves the purpose of a chat application, the emphasis here is on highlighting my capabilities with ReactJS.

## Key ReactJS Concepts Covered
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Building the application using a modular and reusable component structure.
* **State Management:** Effective state management using React's state and, if applicable, state management libraries like Redux or Context API.
* **Real-Time Communication:** Implementing real-time communication features for instant messaging.
* **Component Lifecycle:** Understanding and leveraging React component lifecycle methods for efficient application behavior.
* **Hooks:** Utilizing React hooks for stateful logic and side effects.
* **Styling:** Applying styles to components using various styling approaches, such as CSS-in-JS or styled-components.
* **Routing:** Implementing client-side routing for a seamless user experience.
* **WebSockets:** Incorporating WebSockets for real-time data exchange with Firebase.

## About the Chat App
### Permissions
Upon registration, please read the information regarding permissions carefully.

### Adding Contacts
To start a conversation within the Marcos Chat App, you'll need to add a person by email. There are two options: either add multiple accounts and test with yourself, or add my account using the email "januario.marcos@icloud.com" and chat with me.

## TODO:
Since this app is still in development, having been created in less than a week during my free time,
the following features are planned to be implemented (not necessarily in this order):

- **Settings Menu**
- **Change App color theme**
- **Send text with image**
- **Performance improvements by preventing multiple requests**
- **See the information of my contacts**
- **Being able to upload a new avatar image**
- **Being able to delete/remove an avatar image**
- **Remove a chat from the chat list**
- **Delete specific texts in a conversation**
- **Delete account**
- **Create group chat**
- **Various small improvements that will be implemented on the go, such as improving the UI, since the initial focus was on demonstrating the functionality.**
